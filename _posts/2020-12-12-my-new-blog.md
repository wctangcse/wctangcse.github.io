This is the first post in this new blog of mine. After teaching engineering of
digital systems large and small for a decade, I feel that there are much to
share with the others. While we are still in the pandemic, blogging seems to be
the best way to share and communicate with other each.

In here I would like to keep things simple and easy to understand for most
readers without a technical background, in the same way I would do to my
students.
I decided to start with many topics that confuses my students in the digital
system design classes. For example, the theory behind computer arithmetic and
the design of arithmetic circuits in digital technolgies. Later I will also
write about interfacing between software (i.e. our programs) and hardware (i.e.
our computer).

Of course I would also love to write short stories of my professional work,
whenever it is related digital electronics and systems.

If you have any comments about my articles, feel free to get in touch through my
contacts from [the about page](/about/).
