# Game Description {#desc}

Robot war is a multi-player and partially observable game where agents
try to be the last standing to win. This game is interestingly challenging
to AI, such as collaboration, learning and planning.

The game takes place in a randomly drawn 11 × 11 grid between 4 players. 
Players are placed in the 4 corners of the grid and the level is scattered with
obstacles of two types: wooden/brick and rigid boxes. 
The board is symmetric along the main diagonal. 
The game can be played with full (i.e. see the whole board) or partial
observability. 

The objective of the game is to be the last player alive at the end, or the last
standing team. Players can fire blasts/flames that travel either vertically (up
or down) or horizontally (left or right). 
Flames eliminate players and bricks on collision.
Bricks, when destroyed, may reveal a recharge point, initially hidden to the
players. The player will be reloaded to the full capacity when it arrives at a
recharge point. 

To make sure games are finite, a limit of 800 game ticks is set. 
The play area is generated automatically using a random seed.

# Rules {#rules}

To be released on 22nd Feb Monday.

# Testing Platform {#platform}

- IntelliJ IDEA Community 2020.3
- OpenJDK 15
- Laptop running Windows 10, i7-7500 CPU 2.7 GHz 8 GB

# Getting started {#start}

In order to get the framework installed and running, follow these instructions:
1. Download and install [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), and an appropriate [JDK](https://openjdk.java.net)
2. Download the [sample project](/files/java-robotwar-20210218.zip)
3. Extract the zip and open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.

To verify the project structure is in place,
1. File -> Project Structure
   - Project -> Project SDK (update if required)
   - Libraries (check if lib/\*.jar are listed)
2. Build -> Rebuild project (to generate all classes again)
3. Run -> Edit Configurations
   - Check java version is set correctly.
   - Check working directory is set correctly.

This sets of [screenshots](files/IJs.zip) may be useful for checking the settings.

To verify that *Robot War* can execute, 
1. In the IDE, open the file `src/Test.java` (you can navigate files on the left
panel - click on 1:Project if the folder hierarchy is not displayed).
2. Click on menu Run > Run, and select Test in the pop up window. Alternatively, right click the file Test.java and select the option ‘Run’.
3. It may take a few seconds for the project to be compiled and then it will run a game with four AIs playing.

**Please get in touch with [Matthew](mailto:matthew.tang@qmul.ac.uk) if you hany
issues with the IDE.**

Please work on the following two exercises are to help familiarise yourself with
Robot War and process the information that is given to you in the different
methods that you can implement.

# Exercise 1 - Running the game {#ex1}

There are two classes, `Test.java` and `Run.java`, in the `src/` directory that can
be used to run your bots and also to play the game yourself against the built-in
AIs.

## Single Games

For now, open the class `Test.java`. You’ll see that lines like the following
are repeated: 

    players.add(new ...);

`players` is a Java ArrayList that contains all players for a single game. 
Before a game is started, this array must contain four players - no less, no
more. The order of the players in the array matters: from first to fourth, the
each player is put in a different corner of the map following this order:
top-left, bottom-left, bottom-right, top-right.

By default, the game has two `RandomPlayer` and two `SimplePlayer` playing. 
The different players you can use at the moment in this framework are:

|Bot|Java construction code|
|---|----------------------|
|DoNothing|`new DoNothing(playerID++)`|
|RandomPlayer|`new RandomPlayer(seed, playerID++)`|
|SimplePlayer|`new SimplePlayer(seed, playerID++)`

All the player classes are in `src/players/`. 
The seed is used to generate a random starting board for the game, which
determines the location of the obstacles and recharge point. 
Each seed number genereates a completely different map to play in.

By changing the players that are added to the players array, try now different
combinations of agents playing the game and see how well they do, by running the
class Test.java. 

## Playing as a human

You can also include a human player in the groups of agents that play. A human
player is created as follows:

    new HumanPlayer(ki1, playerID++)

where ki1 is a KeyController object. Substitute the first agent in the array of
players for a new human player. Run the Test class and play the game using the
WASD keys to move and the TFGH keys to fire a blast.

You can actually play the game with up to two human agents:

|Human Agent|Key Controller|Keys|
|-----------|--------------|----|
|Human player 1|`KeyController ki1 = new KeyController(true);`|WASD + TFGH|
|Human player 2|`KeyController ki2 = new KeyController(false);`|Cursor keys + IJKL keys|
  
Configure the game now to play with 2 humans and 2 bots. You can play a few
games with a friend next to you!

## Different game modes

The game can be played in two different game modes, with the following rules: 

Free for all (FFA): All four players are competing against each other.
* Last player standing wins.
* All players that die lose the game.
* Players that are alive at the end tie.
* If the last players alive die on the same tick, they also tie.

Team: The four players are grouped in teams of 2 vs 2.
* They’re always paired 1st-3rd vs 2nd-4th, sited in opposite corners. 
* Team with no agent loses, other team wins.
* If there are players of each team alive at the end, teams tie.
* If the last alive players of each time die on the same tick, teams tie.

The team mode is decided when the Game object is created. See `Test.java`
which by default sets FFA as the game mode:

```java
    Game game = new Game(seed, boardSize, Types.GAME_MODE.FFA, "");
```

In order to change the mode to TEAM, substitute `Types.GAME MODE.FFA` for
`Types.GAME MODE.TEAM` and play the game.

## Different observabilities

All players receive information (presence and location of the different tiles)
about their surroundings. By default, the agents receive information about the
full board (full observability setting). This is indicated by the variable
`DEFAULT_VISION_RANGE` in the class `Types.java` (`src/utils/Types.java`).

When a value $$N > 0$$ is set for the Vision Range, the agent will only receive
information about the tiles at a distance $$\leq N$$  from the location of the agent:
Execute now the game with 4 different bot agents and a PO setting of **2**. 
Observe how the game takes place. 
Note that, with Partial Observability and no human players, you see the vision
of an independent observer, while you can see the visibility of every player on
the right part of the screen. 
* You can press 1, 2, 3 and 4 keys to toggle which agent’s view you display on the
main left panel.
* Press 0 to come back to the independent observer’s view.

## Multiple Games

When trying to determine if an AI is better at Pommerman (or any other
environment, really), it is never enough to play a single game. Because of this,
the framework includes another class (`Run.java`) that allows you to run multiple
games and get comprehensive statistics at the end of the execution.

Open `Run.java` (in `src/`). This class is executed passing 7 parameters as
arguments (although passing none executes a default mode). 
The usage instructions are as follows:

    Usage: java Run [args]
         [arg index = 0] Game Mode. 0: FFA; 1: TEAM
         [arg index = 1] Number of level generation seeds. "-1" to execute with the ones from paper (20).
         [arg index = 2] Repetitions per seed [N]. "1" for one game only with visuals.
         [arg index = 3] Vision Range [VR]. (0, 1, 2 for PO; -1 for Full Observability)
         [arg index = 4-7] Agents. When in TEAM, agents are mates as indices 4-6, 5-7:
             0 DoNothing
             1 Random
             2 SimplePlayer

The total number of games played will be the number of seeds (arg index 1)
multiplied by the number of repetitions by seed (arg index 2). For instance,
running:

    java Run 0 1 1 −1 0 1 2 2

Executes one FFA game with 1 as random seed, full observability and the players
(in this order): DoNothing, Random, SimplePlayer, SimplePlayer
This is also the default setting when no parameters are passed to the class.
Run now `Run.java` to see what happens (Menu ’Run’ → ’Run’ and select ’Run’).
In order to set your own parameters in IntellijIDEA, click on ’Run’ → ’Edit
Configurations...’ and introduce them (separated by spaces) in the field
’Program arguments:’. Try different arguments, setting different number of seeds
(i.e. different levels) and repetitions per seed. 
You should obtain an output with this format:

    0-1-1--1-0-1-2-2 [DoNothing,Random,RuleBased,RuleBased]
    1610113576303, 12129, 0/1, [LOSS (0), LOSS (0), LOSS (0), WIN (0)]
    N 	Win 	Tie 	Loss 	Player (overtime average)
    1	0.0%	0.0%	100.0%	DoNothingPlayer (0.0)
    1	0.0%	0.0%	100.0%	RandomPlayer (0.0)
    1	0.0%	0.0%	100.0%	SimplePlayer (0.0)
    1	100.0%	0.0%	0.0%	SimplePlayer (0.0)

The lines of the output are described as follows:

* Line 1: execution string (with the parameters specified) and agents that played the games.
* Lines 2 onward: seed for the level, game number, result per player (same order as in the first line).
* Last 5 lines: table of results, where each column indicates, from left to right, number of games played, percentage of wins, ties and losses, and the player.

Run this class a few times and try to determine which is the strongest agent of
the ones available by pitching them against each other.

# Exercise 2 - AI Agent {#ex2}

All Robot War AI agents must:

* Extend from the class `Player.java`
* Implement three methods from the base class:
    * `public Types.ACTIONS act(GameState gs)`: this is the most important method. It receives a copy of the current game state and must return an action to execute in the real game. The valid actions are defined in the enumerator `ACTIONS`, located at `Types.java`. Take a look at that data structure.
    * `public Player copy()`: this method creates a copy of this player.
    * `public int[] getMessage()`: this function is called for requesting a message from the player. **Not in use for this competition**.

As an example, take a look at the code two very simple agents:

* DoNothingPlayer (`src/players/DoNothingPlayer.java`), which does, not surprisingly, nothing.
* RandomPlayer (`src/players/RandomPlayer.java`), which executes a random action at every step. The code of the `act()` method is as follows:
 
```java
public Types.ACTIONS act(GameState gs){
    ArrayList<Types.ACTIONS> acts;
    if (random.nextFloat() < 0.8) {
        acts = Types.ACTIONS.moveActions();
        int actionIdx = random.nextInt(acts.size());
        return acts.get(actionIdx);
    }
    else {
        acts = Types.ACTIONS.shootActions();
        int actionIdx = random.nextInt(acts.size());
        return acts.get(actionIdx);
    }
}
```

Take a look at the different methods involved in this call and make sure you understand what is each one of them doing.

The next agent is more sophisticated than the previous two.

SimplePlayer: this agent is a rule based system that analyses the current game state and decides an action without performing any search. 
The state of the game is analysed in the `act()` method of `SimplePlayer.java`, 
checking positions of objects and calculating shortest paths between tiles.
