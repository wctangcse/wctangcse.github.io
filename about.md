I finished his B.Eng in computer engineering, MPhil and PhD in computer science
and engineering from 
the [Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html)
(CUHK) in 2003, 2005 and 2008 respectively.

I am now working as a Senior Lecturer in Embedded Systems at the 
[School of Electric Engineering and Computer Science](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk) (EECS)
of
[Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk) (QMUL).
I teach regularly in the QMUL-BUPT Joint Programme (JP). 
I am now the Deputy Director of the 
[JP Student Innovation Centre](http://eecs.qmul.ac.uk/undergraduate/jpic/)
and the Programme Lead of the Internet of Things Engineering Programme.

I love teaching and am very honoured to receive the Teaching Excellence Award
from BUPT-QMUL Joint Programme in 2017/18 and 
the Dean's Exemplary Teaching awards in CUHK three times in 2010, 2011 & 2013.

Before joining QMUL, I taught in the Department of Computer Science and
Engineering (CSE) of CUHK in a wide range of subjects in computer science and
electronic engineering areas.
